## About Ocular Engine

Ocular Engine is an experimental rendering engine that is under active development.

It was started in August 2014 with the goal of creating a modern, full-featured rendering engine from scratch. Well, as much of one as realistically possible.

The phrase 'experimental' is used for a number of reasons. Primary of these is that Ocular is intended purely as a learning tool. No guarantees are made about future features, design choices, or anything else. It is being made in an effort to learn what works and what doesn't work, and to fully appreciate the immense amount of time and energy that goes into any modern engine.

It is also experimental because at times development may stray outside of the bounds of a pure rendering engine. While the overarching task will always be to develop a modern renderer, there has been past work on features that are not strictly graphics-related. These have included: input/output, editors, object logic, etc. While these are a natural part of a complete game engine, that is not the goal of Ocular.

Ocular is currently the part-time project of [one developer](http://www.vertexfragment.com/home/about.html), and so progresses accordingly.
