# Overview

_(Updated October 3, 2016)_

The following roadmap details new features planned for Ocular. Features are split into three different categories: currently in progress, near future, and future.

The current category details features that are part of the next release version and are the immediate tasks and goals. 

Those in the near future category are likely to be part of the next series of releases, and should be expected within 6 months. This is of course subject to change (another feature may take longer than expected, priority may drop, etc.), but they represent a realistic goal.

Finally, the future category is for anything that has vague plans but is too far down the priority list to receive a more definitive scheduling.

It should be noted that the roadmap is a general plan, and actual development is at times subject to fleeting whims and desires as, after all, this is a project worked on for _fun_.
