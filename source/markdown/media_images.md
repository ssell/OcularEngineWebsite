Found below are screenshots displaying the Ocular Engine in action. 

It should be noted that everything shown can be considered early pre-Alpha status and is subject to change in the future.

## Ocular Editor - Sponza Test Scene

The [Crytek Sponza](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml#2) model is a personal favorite for testing purposes. By itself it can serve as an entire scene, and is sufficiently large and complex enough to ensure that everything is in working order. 

In particular, this scene is demonstrating the lighting system at an early stage of development.

## Ocular Editor - Material Editor

This is a work-in-progress screenshot of the new Material Editor tool built within the main Ocular Editor application. It allows for runtime modification of all materials and it removes the need of manual manipulation of `.omat` files.
